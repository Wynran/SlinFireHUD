# SlinFireHUD
Hi everyone!

Thank you for downloading my TF2 HUD and configuration files created for 1920x1080 resolution. I have no plans for adapting the HUD/config to suit other resolutions.

=============Huge shoutout goes to Aurora for actually coding all of this stuff!!!=============
Without Aurora I definitely couldn't do this. Find Aurora as aurah__ on Twitch.

This download includes the following:  
-My config files, including my key binds and scripts (autoexec, class scripts, etc.) (Updated April 7, 2018)  
-Slinfire HUD, maintained and managed by Aurora
-My hitsound (Quake 3 Hitsound, found in the /sound folder)  

My hud does not include MasterComfig, which is an FPS config that will give you 20-200% better FPS. I highly recommend that you download it!

****** DISCLAIMER!!!! ******
Please don't come back and yell at me if the HUD is installed improperly! I'm happy to help you figure out how to get it to work. Join our Discord at discord.gg/misterslin and ask for assistance.

I HIGHLY recommend that you do NOT copy my config directly (the "cfg" folder). This should be used as a reference to create your own scripts or to see what I use. 
If you copy it directly, it'll mess all of your settings up and I won't be able to undo it for you.

****************************

Installation Instructions:

1. Unzip the .rar and place the "SlinFireHUD" folder directly into C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\team fortress 2\tf\custom and overwrite any necessary files.

1a. If you already have a folder within \tf\custom, I recommend backing up that folder. Then, put the files from slincustomstuff directly into that folder instead and overwrite any necessary files. 
You should only have one folder within \tf\custom.

1b. Want to install just the HUD and not the rest of the config? Copy only the "Materials", "Resource", and "Scripts" folders into your \tf\custom\slincustomstuff or related folder.

2. Set your launch options for Team Fortress 2. You can do this by going to your Steam library > Right Click TF2 > Properties > Set launch options.
	Fullscreen: -dxlevel 95 -full -w 1920 -h 1080 -console -novid -useforcedmparms -noforcemaccel -noforcemspd
	Windowed:   -dxlevel 95 -sw -w 1920 -h 1080 -console -noborder -novid -useforcedmparms -noforcemaccel -noforcemspd

	This will set your game to use DirectX 9.5, with a width of 1920 and a height of 1080, opening developers console on startup, and turning off mouse accel, and no startup vids.

3. I like to put my in-game chat in the top left of my screen, but I know that many of you would like the chat in the default position. Delete \SlinFireHUD\resource\ui\basechat.res and it will default to normal.

Enjoy!
