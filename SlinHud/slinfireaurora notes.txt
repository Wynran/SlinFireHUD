// aura, please feel free to make notes on my notes //

gameplay
> on round win, make the top 3 players menu thing really small so i can either see through it or at least kill people post-round

main menu
> remove featured box cause the man is trying to sell me stuff again

medic
> ubercharge percentage needs to be like the old one (font etc.)
> enemy uber tracking percentage numbers could be a little closer together

target IDs
> bold the health values
> on death screen, make the health number more legible (bold?)
> really i just want old one back lol

bugs:
> randomly when I spawn in casual mode, target ID health unbuffed will be green. other times it will be white. 
>>Fix: white for unbuffed hp. red for hurt, blue for buffed.



things i wish looked like how it used to (including that nick thick font):
> target IDs and medic extra target ID
> spectator HUD / tournament spectator HUD
> death screen aka when you get killed and you see a quick picture of your enemy + health
> scoreboard. i updated your scoreboard with my old file and i think it's fixed
> kill feed... i'm still convinced it's different
> color-coded health everywhere: red = hurt, white = unbuffed, blue = buffed

nice-to-haves:
> remove kill streak counters from everywhere cause I kind of don't care
