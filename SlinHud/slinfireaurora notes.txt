gameplay
> on round win, make the top 3 players menu thing really small because the only chance I get to kill people is post-round when they are like sitting ducks

main menu
> remove featured box cause the man is trying to sell me stuff again, this is because it effets my gameplay peformance clearly TRUST.

medic
> ubercharge percentage needs to be like the old one (font)
> enemy uber tracking percentage numbers need to be a little closer together

target IDs
> bold the health values
> on death screen, make the health number more legible (bold?)
> really i just want old one back lol (but I will comprmise)

bugs:
> randomly when I spawn in casual mode, target ID health unbuffed will be green. other times it will be white. 
>>Fix: white for unbuffed hp. red for hurt, blue for buffed.
