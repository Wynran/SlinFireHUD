NEW NOTES
> badges on win screen don't fit inside the box in casual mode (maybe comp too)

demoman
> sticky counter seems out of place (top left), should be under crosshair where uber charge is on medic
> remove the charge bar from the screen (currently bottom right)


target IDs
> bold the health values
> on death screen, make the health number more legible (bold?)
> really i just want old one back lol





things i wish looked like how it used to (including that nick thick font):
> target IDs and medic extra target ID
> spectator HUD / tournament spectator HUD
> death screen aka when you get killed and you see a quick picture of your enemy + health
> team selection screen (i can't see what's going on in game with the default)
> class selection screen (i can't see what's going on in game with the default)

nice-to-haves:
> remove any mention of "you did this much better than you did in your previous best round" (i.e. on death cam)
> move the engineer build menu so it's not overlapping the chat. i don't know where to put it though...
