> on death screen, make the health number more legible (bold?)

weapon meters
team indicator behind health
health icons>> still a little iffy

things i wish looked like how it used to (including that nick thick font):
> target IDs and medic extra target ID
> spectator HUD / tournament spectator HUD
> death screen aka when you get killed and you see a quick picture of your enemy + health
> scoreboard. i updated your scoreboard with my old file and i think it's fixed - this was the worst slin lol, your old scoreboard was so broken
> kill feed... i'm still convinced it's different - the font was but im gonna make u live with it
> color-coded health everywhere: red = hurt, white = unbuffed, blue = buffed - think I did it all
> team selection screen (i can't see what's going on in game with the default)
> class selection screen (i can't see what's going on in game with the default)

nice-to-haves:
> remove kill streak counters from everywhere cause I kind of don't care
> remove any mention of "you did this much better than you did in your previous best round" (i.e. on death cam)
> move the engineer build menu so it's not overlapping the chat. i don't know where to put it though...
